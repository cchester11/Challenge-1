# Challenge-1
Refactored and consolidated code 

# Purpose
The purpose of this project was refactoring strenuous css code while corresponing html semantics to any CSS manipulation.
My focus was consolidation to enhance the readability and simplicity of the code. 

## Summary
Essentially, there were several redunancies apparent in the starter code including problems with multiple classes for the same styling. 
I crunched elements with individual classes into single classes to provide a more readable CSS sheet.
